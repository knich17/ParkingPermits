Notes:
Parking permits dates aren't being submitted

Viewing/search:
	Should use tabs rather than radio buttons
	Should print all data by default then restrict with queries
	Sort out how it's getting the name

	parking permit - show rego, query by name instead
	HaS - Should print all violations with filters (department, time, place?) and query for description
	parking violations - not tested

HaS violation submission:
	If logged in:
		checkbox to remain annonymous
	if !logged in:
		option to give name
		if name is given option to give department
	Is department the department of the submitter or department responsible for violation?

Parking permit application:
	if logged in:
		if admin:
			currently correct (though department requesting is the aplicants department they belong to)
			automatically approve application
		if !admin:
			all it needs is license plate, vehicle type, start date and duration
	if !logged in:
		currently correct though before submition ask for a password/confirm password and say that an account will be created for them or how it can be accessed
		Alternatively just make them sign-up before applying for permit (signup needed as permit uses userID)

Signup:
	Confirm password

TODO:
